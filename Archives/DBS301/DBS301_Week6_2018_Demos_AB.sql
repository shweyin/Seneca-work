-- Week 6 Demo  (Sub-Queries and putting it together)
-- Using Sportleagues database and Employees database
-- June 12th, 2018

-- Types of Queries
-- SCALAR  - Returns a single value
-- TABULAR - Returns a table with columns and rows

-- SCALAR EXAMPLE:
-- What was the most goals scored in one game by a single player...
SELECT MAX(NumGoals) AS "Max Goals"
FROM tbldatgoalscorers;

-- which player or players scored 5
SELECT DISTINCT playerID
FROM tbldatgoalscorers
WHERE NumGoals = (
    SELECT MAX(NumGoals) AS "Max Goals"
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
    );
-- BUT, we need names...
SELECT namefirst, namelast
FROM tbldatplayers
WHERE playerid IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT playerID
    FROM tbldatgoalscorers
    WHERE NumGoals = (
        SELECT MAX(NumGoals) AS "Max Goals"
        FROM tbldatgoalscorers
        )
    )
ORDER BY namelast, namefirst;

-- List all employees that work in Seattle (Do not use joins)
-- First find the locationid for seattle
SELECT location_id
FROM locations 
WHERE UPPER(City) LIKE 'SEATTLE';
-- What departments are in location 1700 
-- (or whatever locationid got returned)
SELECT department_id 
FROM departments

    WHERE UPPER(City) LIKE 'SEATTLE'

        FROM locations 
        WHERE UPPER(City) LIKE 'SEATTLE'
        )
    )

-- Seattle and their last name starts with "D"
